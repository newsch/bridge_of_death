# Bridge of Death™

_Stop! Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see._
- _Where are you?_
- _What is your linear velocity?_
- _What is your angular velocity?_

Answering these questions and crossing the Bridge of Death™ is the goal of this project.

Built by Evan New-Schmidt and Jonathan Zerez for the Quantitative Engineering Analysis course at Olin College of Engineering.
